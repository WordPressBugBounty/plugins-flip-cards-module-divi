A simple plugin that adds a flip cards module in the Divi builder.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a Flip Cards module to the Divi Builder. Once activated, the Flip Cards module appears in your module list, allowing you to create engaging flip cards anywhere in your Divi layouts. Customize the flip animation with four directional options—Up, Down, Left, or Right and enhance the visual experience with a 3D flip effect that gives text a floating appearance above the background. The plugin is fully compatible with the Visual Builder and offers extensive customization options for both the front and back of the cards.

In addition to text and image customization, the plugin enables you to add a button on the backside of the flip card, making it interactive and functional. Adjust icons, fonts, and background colors to match your site’s design, and fine-tune the animation's duration and easing for a smooth, captivating effect. Tailor every aspect of the flip cards to create a more personalized and engaging user experience.
